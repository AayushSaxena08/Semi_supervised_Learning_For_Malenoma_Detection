# Semi_supervised_Learning_For_Malenoma_Detection
Trained CNN model on GAN for Binary Classification

In this project our mission is to build a model that can perform the image classification using low-resolution photos from a phoneâ€™s camera. Here we have provided with a training dataset, however, only a small fraction of the images have been labeled. To overcome this challenge, I have employ data augmentation techniques, transfer learning and semi-supervised learning with GANs to produce you final model.

Implementing a model for medical use from scratch with GAN (DCGAN).
Only from 200 images & getting accuracy up to 75%
